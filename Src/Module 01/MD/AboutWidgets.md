# About JavaScript Widgets

The field of JS widgets spans more time and electrons that a tutorial can cover. 

<span style="margin-left:20px;">See [About JS Widgets](../../ToC/References.md#widgets)</span> for some consideration of both free and paid JS widgets available in the market. 

Caveat emptor: javascript widgets reflect the programming skill of the developer &ndash; just like every other bit of code out there. The beginner should shun complexity or seek help from users of the widget libraries.

There exists a bias against professional "for-money" libraries in the JS universe. Be aware that the best value may not be free. 

The two most popular **subscription**-based ($) libraries come from *Kendo UI* and *DevExpress*.

Do diligence before selecting a JS library.
